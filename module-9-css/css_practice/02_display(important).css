/* 
The CSS display property is used to define how an HTML element should be displayed on a web page. It controls the type of box used to render the element, and therefore how it interacts with other elements on the page.

There are several possible values for the display property:

block: the element will be displayed as a block-level element, taking up the full width available in its parent container, and forcing other elements to appear below it.

inline: the element will be displayed as an inline-level element, taking up only the space needed for its content, and allowing other inline-level elements to appear alongside it.

inline-block: the element will be displayed as an inline-level element, but will also have a block-like behavior, allowing it to have padding, margins, and a width and height.

none: the element will not be displayed at all, and its space will be removed from the layout.

flex: the element will be displayed as a flexible container, allowing its child elements to be laid out in flexible rows or columns.
grid: the element will be displayed as a grid container, allowing its child elements to be laid out in a grid pattern.

table: the element will be displayed as a table element, with its child elements arranged in a table layout.
The display property can be used to control the layout and positioning of elements on a web page, and is an important part of CSS styling.
